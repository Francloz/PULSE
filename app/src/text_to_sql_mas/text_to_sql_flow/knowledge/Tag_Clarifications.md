Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown of the CDM domains **Observation**, **Measurement**, and **Condition**, based on OMOP documentation and expert forum discussions:

---

## ‚úÖ Observation

* **Definition**: Captures clinical or contextual facts **not** derived from standardized tests or explicit disease processes‚Äîe.g., family history, self-reported lifestyle, allergies, survey or questionnaire responses ([medical-data-models.org][1]).
* **When to use**: Data that arise from examination, questioning, social context, or free-text entries; also things that don‚Äôt fit elsewhere such as ‚Äúdoes the patient smoke?‚Äù ([medical-data-models.org][1]).
* **Data model**: Stored as name/value pairs with flexible types: numeric (`value_as_number`), concept (`value_as_concept_id`), string, or datetime ([medical-data-models.org][1]).

---

## üìä Measurement

* **Definition**: Quantitative or qualitative results **from standardized tests or instruments**, e.g., lab values, vital signs, imaging tests‚Äîeach record represents an actual measurement or test execution ([ohdsi.org][2]).
* **When to use**: Requires a test or instrument-driven process, even if result is qualitative (e.g., +/‚Äì immunoassay) ([ohdsi.org][2]).
* **Data model**: Captures both attribute (what was measured) and result (numeric or coded concept) with units, and can indicate if the test was performed even without a value .

---

## ü©∫ Condition

* **Definition**: Represents clinically significant diagnoses or disease conditions that a patient has experienced‚Äîintended for medical diagnoses ([medical-data-models.org][1]).
* **When to use**: Whenever there's an ongoing or acute condition, sign/symptom, or diagnosis. Even if represented in source data via ICD/SNOMED, map to **Condition** when it indicates active disease ([ohdsi.github.io][3]).
* **Data model**: Each row indicates a patient ‚Äúhad‚Äù the condition at a certain time; no storing of absence or ‚Äúnegatives‚Äù ‚Äì OMOP assumes absence of a record = absence of condition ([forums.ohdsi.org][4]).

### üóÇÔ∏è Comparison Table

| Feature              | **Observation**                                         | **Measurement**                       | **Condition**                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Data source**      | Questioning, ideation, non-test facts                   | Standard test or instrument           | Diagnostic/asserted condition           |
| **Use cases**        | Survey answers, family history, lifestyle               | Lab results, vitals, instrument tests | Diagnoses, symptoms, clinical condition |
| **Data type**        | name/value pairs (concept/string/number/datetime)       | numeric or coded result, units        | condition concept with dates            |
| **Negative values?** | Supports explicit ‚ÄúNo‚Äù values via `value_as_concept_id` | Possible but rare                     | Not allowed‚Äîomission indicates absence  |

### üî¨ Forum Insight

From OHDSI forums:

* **Measurements** always require a test to generate the fact; **Observations** generally do not ([ohdsi.org][2]).
* Complex ‚Äúquestion/answer‚Äù EAV data (e.g. surveys) may land in Observation or Measurement depending on context ([forums.ohdsi.org][5]).
* Recording a condition's **absence** (like ‚Äúno hypertension‚Äù) is done in *Observation* with value indicating absence‚Äînot in Condition ([forums.ohdsi.org][5]).

### üß≠ When to Choose Which

1. **Patient answers ‚ÄúDo you smoke?‚Äù ‚Üí Observation** (self-reported)
2. **Lab test: serum glucose = 120 mg/dL ‚Üí Measurement**
3. **EHR diagnosis: Type 2 diabetes ‚Üí Condition**

### üìö Want more?

* OMOP wiki documentation for **Measurement** and **Observation** tables is excellent ([ohdsi.github.io][3], [ohdsi.org][2]).
* OHDSI forums offer lively discussions on borderline cases and ETL best practices ([forums.ohdsi.org][6]).

Let me know if you'd like examples from real ETL scripts or need help mapping your specific data!
